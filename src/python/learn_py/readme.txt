Quick Reference Checklist
When reviewing your code, ask yourself:
Readability:

 Are my variable names descriptive?
 Are my functions doing one thing well?
 Would someone else understand this code?

Python Features:

 Am I using list/dict comprehensions where appropriate?
 Am I using f-strings for formatting?
 Am I using with statements for file operations?

Best Practices:

 Am I handling errors specifically?
 Am I avoiding mutable default arguments?
 Am I importing only what I need?

Built-ins:

 Can I use enumerate(), zip(), or range() here?
 Can I use any(), all(), min(), max(), or sum()?
 Am I using the right data structure (list, dict, set)?
